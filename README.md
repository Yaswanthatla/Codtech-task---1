Domain:VLSI design

Duration:8 weeks( 1st june to 30th july)

mentor: sravani gouni

Overview
In this project, we focused on designing and simulating fundamental digital logic circuits using Verilog within a VLSI software environment. The project encompassed the creation of basic logic gates (AND, OR, NOT), a single-bit full adder, and a 2-to-1 multiplexer. Each module was developed to perform specific logic functions, and a comprehensive testbench was implemented to simulate the full adder, verifying its operation through waveform analysis. This approach allowed us to ensure the correctness and reliability of our designs, providing a solid foundation for understanding and developing more complex digital systems.

Conclusion
The successful design and simulation of basic digital logic circuits in this project highlight the effectiveness of using Verilog and VLSI tools for digital system development. By implementing and verifying the functionality of simple components like logic gates, a full adder, and a multiplexer, we established a crucial understanding of digital design principles. The process of simulating these designs and analyzing their behavior through waveform viewers confirmed their proper operation. This project not only reinforced fundamental concepts in digital logic design but also equipped us with practical skills essential for advancing to more sophisticated VLSI design projects.
